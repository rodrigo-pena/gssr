SEGMENTATION FILE FORMAT
David Martin
8/2/2001

This document describes the segmentation file format.  Segmentation
files end in ".seg".

The overall structure of the file is as follows:

	<header>
	data
	<data>

The first part of the file is the header.  The header is ascii text,
and can contain comments.  The comment character is '#'.  The header
is separated from the data with a line containing the literal text
"data".

The header can contain the following information, in any order:

	format {*ascii|binary} {*cr|map}
	date <date string>
	image <int>	# image ID number
	user <int>	# user ID number
	width <int>	# width of image
	height <int>	# height of image
	segments <int>	# number of segments
	gray {*0|1}	# image presented in grayscale?
	invert {*0|1}	# image presented with pixel values inverted?
	flipflop {*0|1}	# image presented upside-down and backwards?

The {width,height,segments} lines are required.  All others lines are
optional.  Default values are marked with a '*'.

The format line describes the format of the data section of the file.
The default and recommended format is 'ascii cr' (cr = compressed
row).  This document does not describe the other formats, as they are
probably superfluous.

The 'ascii cr' format is designed to be very easy to parse; it is not
optimized for space.  Use gzip if you want smaller files!  Each line
in the data section contains 4 integers:

	<s> <r> <c1> <c2>

All values start counting at 0.  <s> is the segment number; <r> is the
row; <c1> and <c2> are column numbers.  The line means that columns
[<c1>..<c2>] of row <r> belong to segment <s>.  Lines of this sort can
appear in any order, and can be reordered without harm.  The only
restriction is that each pixel must be named exactly once.
